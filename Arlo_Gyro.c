   NOTE About Gyro module:
   Currently this code makes NO use of the gyro. The Odometry from the ArloBot's wheel encoders is excellent!
   The only thing I do with the gyro is send the data to ROS and display it on the web interface.
   At some point a ROS node could use that data to detect a serious issue, like the robot being picked up or being stuck.
   As it is though, gmapping, AMCL, etc. work very well off of the Odometry without using the gyro data.
